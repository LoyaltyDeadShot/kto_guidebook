# [QB/QBX] [OX] KTO Guidebook
Welcome to this script, this is my first ever release script that I've made for FiveM. This script includes a guidebook that can help your citizens learn the rules or other important information and includes the following things:
- Add item to open the menu with. A premade item comes with the script, called 'guide';
- Adds a 'book' emote (with scullyemote implementation). This emote is also configurable in the config.lua and can be changed to the emote you like;
- Has a large configuration file for this small script size: configure icons, icon colors and emotes;
- Easily adjustable to QB or ESX, just change the server event and the local QBCore = exports['qb-core']:GetCoreObject()
- Easily adjustable strings for all the 4 premade bookmarks
- Small guide included on how to make extra bookmarks in client and strings, see bookmark 5; üêà
